# teamtoobig.com

This repo contains the source for [teamtoobig.com](https://teamtoobig.com/), the official website of Team Toobig.

The site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).



## Developing

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`).

At the root of this repo, run

```
npm run start
```

The site will build and be hosted at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you edit the files on your machine, the localhost page will auto-reload so you can immediately see your changes.

Whenever a commit is pushed to the `main` branch of this repository (or whenever a pull request is merged to `main`), the live website at https://teamtoobig.com is immediately and automatically updated via Github Actions.
